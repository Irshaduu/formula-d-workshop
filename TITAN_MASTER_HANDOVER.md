## 🏎️ I. THE MISSION

**WorkshopOS** is an industrial-grade, multi-tenant SaaS application meticulously engineered for premium automotive workshop management. 

- **The Standard**: 100% functional integrity. 91 industrial-strength automated tests are currently passing (91% overall coverage), guaranteeing zero-failure tolerance in core operations.

## 🛡️ II. CORE ARCHITECTURE (The "Steel Gate")

> [!WARNING]
> *This section documents the mission-critical security and data-integrity logic of WorkshopOS. These systems are foundational and must never be broken or bypassed.*

### 1. Zero-Trust Security & Lockout (`FailedAttempt`)
- **Mechanism**: The system captures and tracks login failures by **Network IP** (`REMOTE_ADDR`), completely bypassing superficial session/cookie-based tracking.
- **The Rule**: 5 consecutive failed attempts trigger a global 15-minute lockout for that IP address, effectively neutralizing botnets and brute-force attacks.
- **Integrity Check**: Verified in `workshop/test_auth.py`. 
  *Note for developers: Tests must call `FailedAttempt.objects.all().delete()` in `setUp` to prevent cross-test contamination.*

### 2. Dual-Channel "Buddy Watch" Incident Response
- **Mechanism**: Any successful authentication into the HQ Command Portal instantly triggers asynchronous broadcasts to **both** business owners (Sahad & Rijas).
- **Channels**: Primary routing via the Telegram Bot API (fast, secure) with an automatic fallback to Twilio SMS.
- **Payload**: Transmits the compromised Username, parsed Device fingerprint, and Network IP. 

### 3. Hardware Fingerprinting & Session Command (`UserSession`)
- **Device Parsing**: Explicitly hardened logic that decodes raw HTTP User-Agent strings into human-readable device names (e.g., *Apple Safari on iPhone*).
- **The HQ Kill Switch**: From the management dashboard, Owners have God-mode visibility over active staff sessions (40-day window). The `manage_terminate_session` function allows for surgical, remote destruction of unauthorized Django sessions.

### 4. The Warehouse Pulse (Stock Delta Engine)
- **Mechanism**: Uses Django Signals (`inventory/signals.py`) to orchestrate seamless Workshop-to-Warehouse synchronization.
- **The Logic**: It calculates exact stock deltas during job card updates. It accurately handles complex scenarios including Part Replacements (restoring old stock, deducting new), Quantity Adjustments, and full Deletions.

## 🚀 III. HIGH-PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING (1M+ Records)

WorkshopOS is optimized for immense scale, ensuring sub-50ms data retrieval even as the database grows to over a million records.

> [!TIP]
> **Performance Guardrails**
> - **O(1) Data Retrieval**: All major list views enforce Server-Side Pagination (21 items for grids, 50 for floor lists).
> - **Greedy Query Mapping**: Strict enforcement of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` across models to eliminate Django's N+1 query latency.
> - **Denormalized Financials**: The `JobCard.total_bill_amount` is a physical database column, quietly updated via model methods during part/labour saves to prevent crashing the server with runtime calculations.
> - **B-Tree Indexing**: Critical lookup fields (`is_deleted`, `registration_number`, `admitted_date`) utilize `db_index=True`.

## 🔧 IV. OPERATIONAL COMMANDS

*Run these commands to verify the "Titan Standard" integrity at any time.*

- **Full Integrity Audit**: 
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py test workshop inventory
  ```
- **Current State**: 91 Tests passing (91% coverage).

---

## 🧹 V. THE PRISTINE WORKSPACE (v4.7.1 Update)

- **Master Wipe**: Every temporary log, diagnostic script, and forensic trace has been eradicated from the production directory.
- **Core-Only Architecture**: The repository root is now 100% lean, containing only application code, migration files, and documented standards. 
- **Environment Isolation**: All critical credentials (Owner mobile numbers, Telegram Chat IDs, Twilio keys) are strictly segregated into the `.env` file, maintaining absolute "Separation of Configuration from Code".

---

## 🚀 VI. THE NEXT PHASE: ADVANCED UPDATIONS

*Immediate strategic goals for the upcoming sprint:*

### 1. Advanced Job Card Updations
- Enhance the Job Card logic to include sophisticated operational fields (e.g., service cycles, technician performance metrics, automated cost estimations).
- Refine the denormalization of billing data for even higher frontend performance.

### 2. Admin Special Sections (HQ Analytics)
- Develop high-level, visual analytics and financial reporting exclusively for owners (Sahad & Rijas).
- Introduce custom operational reporting that completely bypasses the standard staff view.

### 3. "Premium" UX Expansion
- Continue implementing the **Industrial Hybrid Theme** (Racy Dark Navigation / Clinical Light Body).
- Introduce premium micro-animations and professional transition effects (e.g., Skeleton Loading shimmers) for a native-app feel.

## 💡 VII. AI & DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS (The "Titan" Creed)

1. **Maintain the Standard**: "Fix the code, not the tests." If a test fails, the logic is likely wrong. Never bypass a security test.
2. **Industrial Grade Aesthetics**: No placeholders. No generic colors. Use harmonious color palettes (HSL), responsive layouts, and professional typography. The UI must match the premium quality of the backend.
3. **Titan Integrity**: Every new feature **must** be accompanied by new `assertEqual` tests covering edge cases. 
4. **Communicate like a Titan**: Commit messages and documentation must be concise, professional, and confident.

> **WorkshopOS: Stable. Secure. Scale-Ready.** 🛰️🏎️💨
