# 🏛️ TITAN MASTER HANDOVER: WorkshopOS (v6.9)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status**: 🛡️ SECURITY HARDENED | 🔧 IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT  
> **Last Updated**: June 2026  
> **Version**: 6.9  

---

## 🏎️ I. THE MISSION

**WorkshopOS** is an industrial-grade application meticulously engineered for a single premium automotive workshop. 

- **The Standard**: Functional integrity across all mission-critical operations. The system is backed by a comprehensive test suite spanning **18+ test files** covering security, views, signals, financial logic, cashbook operations, and spare shop management.

## 🛡️ II. CORE ARCHITECTURE (The "Steel Gate")

> [!WARNING]
> *This section documents the mission-critical security and data-integrity logic of WorkshopOS. These systems are foundational and must never be broken or bypassed.*

### 1. IP-Based Security & Lockout (`FailedAttempt`)
- **Mechanism**: The system captures and tracks login failures strictly by the direct **Network IP** (`REMOTE_ADDR`). `X-Forwarded-For` proxy headers are intentionally ignored to permanently prevent client-side IP spoofing bypasses.
- **The Rule**: 5 consecutive failed attempts trigger a global 15-minute lockout for that IP address, effectively neutralizing botnets and brute-force attacks.
- **Integrity Check**: Verified in `workshop/test_auth.py`.  
  *Note for developers: Tests must call `FailedAttempt.objects.all().delete()` in `setUp` to prevent cross-test contamination.*

### 2. Dual-Channel Notification System (⚠️ Current — New System Planned)
- **Mechanism**: Any successful authentication triggers alert broadcasts to **both** business owners.
- **Channels**: Primary routing via the Telegram Bot API (fast, secure) with Twilio SMS as a parallel channel.
- **Payload**: Transmits the Username, parsed Device fingerprint, and Network IP.
- **⚠️ Note**: The current SMS/Telegram notification system may be replaced with a new architecture in a future release.

### 3. Hardware Fingerprinting & Session Command (`UserSession`)
- **Device Parsing**: Explicitly hardened logic that decodes raw HTTP User-Agent strings into human-readable device names (e.g., *Apple Safari on iPhone*).
- **The HQ Kill Switch**: From the management dashboard, Owners have full visibility over active staff sessions (40-day window). The `manage_terminate_session` function allows for surgical, remote destruction of unauthorized Django sessions.

### 4. The Warehouse Pulse (Stock Delta Engine)
- **Mechanism**: Uses Django Signals (`inventory/signals.py`) to orchestrate seamless stock synchronization from **two directions**.
- **Workshop Consumption (3 signals)**: Calculates exact stock deltas during job card updates. Handles Part Replacements (restoring old stock, deducting new), Quantity Adjustments, and full Deletions.
- **Supplier Restocking (3 signals)**: Automatically increases stock when restock bills are created, adjusts by delta on edits, and reverses on deletion. Uses the same pre_save snapshot + post_save delta pattern for consistency.

## 🚀 III. HIGH-PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING (1M+ Records)

WorkshopOS is optimized for immense scale, ensuring sub-50ms data retrieval even as the database grows to over a million records.

> [!TIP]
> **Performance Guardrails**
> - **O(1) Data Retrieval**: All major list views enforce Server-Side Pagination (21 items for grids, 50 for floor lists).
> - **Greedy Query Mapping**: Strict enforcement of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` across models to eliminate Django's N+1 query latency.
> - **Denormalized Financials**: The `JobCard.total_bill_amount` is a physical database column, updated via `update_totals()` during part/labour saves to prevent expensive runtime calculations.
> - **B-Tree Indexing**: Critical lookup fields (`is_deleted`, `registration_number`, `admitted_date`, `delivered`, `updated_at`) utilize `db_index=True`.
> - **Composite Indexes**: Dashboard query pattern covered by `[is_deleted, delivered, -updated_at]` composite index.

## 🔧 IV. OPERATIONAL COMMANDS

*Run these commands to verify system integrity at any time.*

- **Full Integrity Audit**: 
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py test workshop inventory
  ```
- **Test Coverage**: 18+ test files across workshop (15+) and inventory (3).

---

## 🧹 V. THE PRISTINE WORKSPACE

- **Core-Only Architecture**: The repository root contains only application code, migration files, and documented standards.
- **Environment Isolation**: All critical credentials (Owner mobile numbers, Telegram Chat IDs, Twilio keys) are strictly segregated into the `.env` file, maintaining absolute "Separation of Configuration from Code".
- **Split Settings**: `settings/` package auto-selects development (SQLite) or production (PostgreSQL) via `DJANGO_ENV` environment variable.
- **Modular Views**: The monolithic `views.py` has been refactored into a `views/` package with 12 focused modules, maintaining full backward compatibility via re-exports in `__init__.py`.

---

## 🔜 VI. COMING SOON — FUTURE FEATURES

*Strategic goals for upcoming sprints:*

### 1. PostgreSQL Production Database
- Full production deployment with PostgreSQL for multi-million record reliability.
- Production settings already prepared in `settings/production.py` with SSL/HSTS hardening.

### 2. Admin Data Analysis & Reports (Coming Soon)
- High-level visual analytics and financial reporting exclusively for Owners.
- Custom operational reporting that completely bypasses the standard staff view.

### 3. New Notification System (Replacing SMS/Telegram)
- The current Twilio SMS + Telegram Bot notification architecture will be replaced.
- New system architecture is under planning.

### 4. Production Hardening
- `DEBUG` will be set to `False` in production.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` will be restricted to specific domains (currently `['*']` for development).
- Full SSL enforcement and HSTS headers.

## 💡 VII. AI & DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS (The "Titan" Creed)

1. **Maintain the Standard**: "Fix the code, not the tests." If a test fails, the logic is likely wrong. Never bypass a security test.
2. **Industrial Grade Aesthetics**: No placeholders. No generic colors. Use harmonious color palettes (HSL), responsive layouts, and professional typography. The UI must match the premium quality of the backend.
3. **Titan Integrity**: Every new feature **must** be accompanied by new `assertEqual` tests covering edge cases. 
4. **Communicate like a Titan**: Commit messages and documentation must be concise, professional, and confident.

> **WorkshopOS: Stable. Secure. Scale-Ready.** 🛰️🏎️💨
