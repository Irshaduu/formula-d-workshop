# WorkshopOS — Workshop Management System

A premium, comprehensive Django-based workshop management system designed to streamline automotive service operations. Manage job cards, inventory, customer vehicles, spare shop finances, bulk payments, and invoicing all in one professional platform.

## Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Three-Tier Permissions** — Dedicated access levels for **Owner**, **Office**, and **Floor (Mechanic)** roles.
- **Secure Admin Hub** — Password-protected Owner login with direct access and real-time security alerts.
- **Role-specific UI** — Dynamic navigation and information visibility based on user groups.

### Job Card Management
- **Digital Job Cards** — Create and manage service records with customer details, vehicle information, and work performed.
- **Real-time Status Tracking** — Progress bars and visual status cues on the Dashboard and Live Report views.
- **Auto-Learning Database** — System automatically captures new concerns and spare parts for future smart-suggestions (Case-insensitive & Whitespace Normalized).
- **Safety Hardened** — Double-confirmation modals for renames and deletes, and Dynamic Merge Alerts to protect historical data.
- **Duplicate Detection** — 3-attempt confirmation system prevents accidental duplicate entries for active vehicles.

### Finance & Suppliers
- **Spare Shops Management** — Dedicated module for tracking parts suppliers, monitoring outstanding balances, and managing lump-sum supplier payments with cascade distribution.
- **Bulk Payer Management** — Dedicated module for managing repeating/fleet customers with cascading bulk payments chronologically (oldest-first).
- **Pending Bills Dashboard** — Centralized view of all unpaid/partially-paid jobs across the system.
- **JSON Snapshot Reversal** — Every payment records a JSON snapshot enabling precise, surgical reversal by the Owner.

### Inventory System
- **Stock Management** — Track parts and consumables with low-stock alerts and percentage-based color coding.
- **Consumption Tracking** — Automatically record part usage from job cards via Django Signals (real-time delta sync).
- **Category Organization** — Group inventory items for easier management and restocking.
- **Supplies Shops** — Dedicated supplier management module for tracking inventory suppliers, creating restock bills, recording supplier payments, and maintaining a per-supplier catalog. Stock levels auto-increase on restock and auto-reverse on bill deletion via signals.

### Dashboard & Layout
- **Live Report Dashboard** — High-visibility "Floor" view for mechanics and "Live Report" for office staff.
- **Mobile Optimized** — Premium responsive design with a native-app feel and bottom navigation on mobile.
- **Skeleton Loading** — Professional shimmer animations for a smooth, high-performance user experience.

### Invoice & Billing
- **Professional Invoices** — Auto-generated, itemized invoices with company branding.
- **Cost Analytics** — Automatic calculations for parts, labour, and tax.
- **Sequential Billing** — Standardized, thread-safe billing numbers (e.g., JB-26-001).

### Data Management
- **Soft-Delete & Restore** — Full trash system with Owner-only restore and permanent delete.
- **Unified Tabbed Trash** — Single trash page with tabbed views for Job Cards, Bulk Payers, Payments, Spare Shops, and Shop Payments.
- **Data Cleanup Tool** — Rename, merge, and delete duplicate entries across master lists with cascade updates.
- **Car Profiles** — Vehicle history tracking grouped by registration number with chronological visit numbering.

## 🛡️ Titan Standard: Automated Reliability
WorkshopOS is backed by an **industrial-grade test suite** across **16 test files** covering security, models, views, API endpoints, signals, middleware, financial logic, and supplier management — all with zero-failure tolerance.
- **100% Security Coverage**: Verified IP-lockouts, password authentication, and real-time session revocation.
- **100% Warehouse Pulse**: Verified stock-delta signals (Creation, Update, Name Change, Deletion).
- **100% Model Integrity**: Verified every lifecycle transition for Job Cards and User Sessions.

## 🚀 Enterprise Scalability (1M+ Records)
Designed from the ground up to handle a **Million Vehicles** without performance degradation:
- **O(1) Memory Usage**: Server-side pagination (21-50 records per page) ensures constant speed regardless of database size.
- **B-Tree Database Indexing**: Critical fields (`registration_number`, `admitted_date`, `is_deleted`, `delivered`, `updated_at`) are professionally indexed for sub-50ms retrieval.
- **Query Hardening**: All views utilize `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to eliminate N+1 latency.
- **Composite Indexes**: Dashboard query pattern covered by multi-field composite index (`is_deleted`, `delivered`, `-updated_at`).

## 🔐 Steel Gate Security
- **Network-Level Defense**: `FailedAttempt` tracks login failures by IP address, not just cookies.
- **Collaborative Alert System**: Instant cross-notifications to both Owners on every login event via SMS + Telegram (⚠️ current system — new notification system planned).
- **HQ Command Switch**: One-click termination of any unauthorized session from the management dashboard.

## 🔜 Coming Soon
- **PostgreSQL Production Database** — Multi-million record production-grade deployment.
- **Admin Data Analysis & Reports** — High-level visual analytics and financial reporting for Owners.
- **New Notification System** — Replacement for current SMS/Telegram bot architecture.
