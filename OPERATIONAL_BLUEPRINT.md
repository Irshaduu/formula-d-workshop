## 3. JOB CARD — THE CENTRAL HUB

Everything in the system connects through the Job Card:

```
                    MECHANIC
                    (Roster)
                       |
                  assigned to
                       |
 MASTER LISTS -----> JOB CARD -------> INVOICE
 (Brands,Models,      |                |
  Spares,Concerns)    |                |
     ^                |             PAYMENT
     | auto-learn     |             STATUS
     |                |
     |     +----------+----------+
     |     |          |          |
     |  CONCERNS    SPARES    LABOUR
     |  - Text      - Part     - Job Desc
     |  - Status:   - Qty      - Amount
     |   PENDING    - Shop $
     |   WORKING    - Cust $
     |   FIXED      - Shop FK
     |              - Status:
     |              PENDING
     |              ORDERED
     |              RECEIVED
     |                |
     |                | auto-sync (signals)
     |                v
     |          INVENTORY
     |          (Warehouse)
     |                |
     +------->  TOTAL BILL AMOUNT
           = Sum(Spare Customer Prices)
           + Sum(Labour Amounts)
           Auto-calculated on every save
           (denormalized for performance)
```

---

## 4. BILLING & FINANCIAL FLOW

### Cost Accumulation

```
Spare Part Added (Customer Price) --+
                                    +--> Total Bill Auto-Calculated --> Invoice
Labour Added (Amount) -------------+     (denormalized, updates on every save)
```

### Payment States

```
PENDING   = Nothing received yet
PARTIAL   = Some money received, balance remains
PAID      = Full amount received (discount auto-calculated if received < bill)
BULK_PAID = Paid via bulk/fleet payment system
```

### Payment Methods

```
CASH     = Cash payment
UPI      = UPI / QR Code
CARD     = Credit/Debit Card
TRANSFER = Bank Transfer
```

### Spare Part Pricing (Two-Price System)

```
Shop Price (Unit Price)  = What YOU paid to the parts shop
Customer Price (Total)   = What the CUSTOMER pays (with your markup)
Profit per part = Customer Price - (Shop Price x Quantity)
```

### Bulk/Fleet Payment (Cascade Algorithm)

```
Customer "XYZ" has 5 unpaid jobs:

Job 1: Rs.3,000 balance (oldest)
Job 2: Rs.5,000 balance
Job 3: Rs.2,000 balance
Job 4: Rs.4,000 balance
Job 5: Rs.1,000 balance (newest)

Customer pays Rs.10,000 lump sum:

Job 1: Rs.3,000 paid  (remaining: Rs.7,000)
Job 2: Rs.5,000 paid  (remaining: Rs.2,000)
Job 3: Rs.2,000 paid  (remaining: Rs.0)
Job 4: Rs.0 -- funds exhausted
Job 5: Rs.0 -- funds exhausted

Result: 3 jobs fully paid, 2 still pending
JSON snapshot saved for precise reversal if needed
```

### Spare Shop Payment (Cascade Algorithm)

```
Same oldest-first cascade logic applies to shop payments.
Lump sum distributed across unpaid items chronologically.
Each payment creates a JSON snapshot for Owner reversal.
```

---

## 5. INVENTORY <-> JOB CARD AUTO-SYNC

```
JOB CARD ACTION                      WAREHOUSE EFFECT
----------------------------------------------
Add "Oil Filter" x 2           -->   Oil Filter: 10 to 8  (auto -2)
Change qty to 5                -->   Oil Filter: 8 to 5   (auto -3 delta)
Change to "Air Filter"         -->   Oil Filter: 5 to 10  (auto +5 restore)
                               -->   Air Filter: 7 to 2   (auto -5 deduct)
Delete spare line              -->   Air Filter: 2 to 7   (auto +5 restore)
```

### Low Stock Alert System

```
Each item has:  Average Stock (ideal level)
                Current Stock (actual count)

Health = (Current / Average) x 100%

 Green  (50%+)   = Healthy stock
 Yellow (25-49%) = Warning, reorder soon
 Red    (below 25%) = Critical, order immediately
```

## 5B. SUPPLIES SHOPS (INVENTORY SUPPLIERS)

```
SUPPLIES SHOP (Inventory Supplier)
   ├── Name, Phone, Active/Inactive Status
   ├── Catalog (linked inventory items this supplier stocks)
   │
   ├── Restock Bills:
   │     Each bill records a purchase from this supplier
   │     Bill → Line Items (inventory Item + qty + unit price)
   │     Stock auto-increases on bill creation (via signals)
   │     Stock auto-reverses on bill deletion
   │     Optional discount per bill
   │
   ├── Financial Ledger:
   │     Total Billed = SUM(bill total_amount - discount_amount)
   │     Total Paid = SUM(payments where is_trashed=False)
   │     Pending Balance = Total Billed - Total Paid
   │
   ├── Payment Options:

   │
   └── AJAX Pagination:
         Bills and Payments tabs load via AJAX partials
         Independent search + date filtering
```

### How Supplies Shops Connect to Inventory

```
SUPPLIER ACTION                      WAREHOUSE EFFECT
----------------------------------------------
Create restock bill (5x Oil Filter)  →   Oil Filter: 10 to 15  (auto +5)
Edit bill qty to 8                   →   Oil Filter: 15 to 18  (auto +3 delta)
Delete bill entirely                 →   Oil Filter: 18 to 10  (auto -8 reverse)
```

### Supplies Shops vs Spare Shops

```
                    SUPPLIES SHOPS              SPARE SHOPS
                    (Inventory App)             (Workshop App)
Purpose:            Buy parts INTO warehouse    Buy parts FOR specific jobs
Linked To:          Inventory Items (FK)        Job Card Spare Items (FK)
Stock Effect:       Increases stock             N/A (tracked separately)
Bill Structure:     Restock Bills + Line Items  Per-job spare items
Payment System:     Quick payments + soft-delete Cascade waterfall + JSON snapshot
Access:             Office+                     Office+
```

## 6. AUTOCOMPLETE — SMART LEARNING SYSTEM

```
MASTER LISTS (Knowledge Base)          JOB CARD FORM
----------------------------          ---------------
CarBrand: Toyota, BMW, Audi      <->  Brand field (autocomplete)
CarModel: Corolla, 3 Series      <->  Model field (dependent on brand)
SparePart: Oil Filter, Brake     <->  Spare Part field (autocomplete)
ConcernSolution: Brake noise     <->  Concern field (autocomplete)
```

**AUTO-LEARN**: When you type a NEW spare part or concern that doesn't exist in the master list, the system AUTOMATICALLY adds it for future use (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized).

**INVENTORY PRIORITY**: When searching spares, items found in the Warehouse show FIRST (highlighted in yellow), then master list items.

---

## 7. SPARE SHOP MANAGEMENT

```

## 10. DATA CLEANUP — KEEPING THINGS CLEAN

```
PROBLEM: Over time, typos accumulate in master lists
         "Oil Filter", "oil filter", "Oil Filtr", "OIL FILTER"

CLEANUP TOOL:
  Spare: "Oil Filtr" (used in 3 job cards)
  [Rename to "Oil Filter"]  [Delete]
  --> Rename updates ALL 3 job cards too!
  --> If "Oil Filter" already exists: MERGE WARNING

Same for Concerns:
  "brake noise" + "Brake Noise" --> Merge into one
